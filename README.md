# Nigeria-s-Performance-in-the-Last-3-AFCON-Editions

The Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), officially known as the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations for sponsorship purposes, is the premier biennial international men's football tournament in Africa. Organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), the competition was first held in 1957 and has occurred every two years since 1968, shifting to odd-numbered years in 2013.

Nigeria has won the tournament three times and most recently secured an impressive second-place finish. In preparation for the upcoming edition, I compiled and analyzed data from the past three tournaments, focusing on key statistics such as player names, positions, ages, matches played, goals, assists, and more.

The first step of this project was data acquisition, which I sourced from FBref. I then used Microsoft Excel to clean and organize the data, refining it to include only relevant metrics. I structured the dataset into Excel-recognized tables for seamless analysis. A sample of the final dataset can be seen below:

After finalizing the dataset, I imported it into Tableau to create a series of interactive visualizations. These include detailed summaries of crucial metrics and dynamic visuals highlighting player impact, disciplinary records, and total goals scored per player, among other insights. Some of which can be seen below:
